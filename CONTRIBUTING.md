# How to contribute

### ‚ùó **Common mistakes**

- Opening a pull request without a description or a proper name is not fun for the reviewer, so try to explain your change as much as possible either by text or a code snippet.
- Adding new dependencies or modifying the `package.json` will most likely be not accepted or will be accepted in a long time since adding a new dependency to the codebase can be tricky.
- This project uses `npm`, so please try to respect the choice and try to use it.
