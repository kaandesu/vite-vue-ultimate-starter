It comes pre-configured with
several essential dependencies that will help you get started with your Vue3 project right away.

[Live Demo](https://kaandesu.github.io/vite-vue-ultimate-starter/)

## Out of the box

### Vue3

- #### [PWA Plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-pwa): A Vite plugin that helps you build progressive web applications (PWA) by generating a service worker and a manifest file for your application.
- #### [Vue Router](https://github.com/vuejs/router): A router library that helps you handle client-side navigation in your application.
- #### [Typescript](https://github.com/vuejs/language-tools): Adds static type checking to your javascript code.

### Testing

- #### [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/): A testing library for running end-to-end tests in your application.
- #### [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/): A unit testing library, can also be used to test components with `vue test utils`.

### Styling

- #### [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindui.com/): A utility-first CSS framework that helps you build custom user interfaces.
- #### [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/): A minimalistic component library for tailwind CSS. It offers a simple and clean design for your application's UI.
- #### [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/): A CSS preprocessor that allows you to use variables and functions in your CSS.

### Code Quality

- #### [ESLint](https://eslint.org/): A linting tool for JavaScript and TypeScript code.
- #### [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): A code formatter that ensures consistency in your code style.

### Custom Composables

- #### useThemeManager: A composable that allows you to change the theme of your application.
  - setTheme: Dynamically sets the theme of your application from [DaisyUI themes](https://daisyui.com/docs/themes/).
  - getTheme: Returns the current theme of your application.
  - toggleDark: Toggles the theme of your application between light and dark.
  ```ts
  import { useThemeManager } from '@/composables/useThemeManager'
  const { setTheme, getTheme, toggleDark } = useThemeManager()
  getTheme() // initial value is 'default'
  setTheme('dark')
  getTheme() // 'dark'
  toggleDark() // 'light'
  ```

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur & built-in typescript) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).
